# AKS-Adv-Provision

My views on deploying AKS with advanced provisions for development and production environments. 

## Provisioning Scripts and Configuration

Under [Provisions](/provisioning) folder you will find all deployment scripts and configuration. 

I've put all the commands in a single sequential shell script [aks-cluster.sh](provisioning/aks-cluster.sh)

> **NOTE:** This is a work on progress and will keep improving when I can to include recently released AKS features and versions

Currently the scripts applied to:
- Azure CLI version 2.0.73
- AKS Kubernetes version 1.15.3 (currently preview on AKS)
- kubectl version 1.15.3
- helm version 2.14.3

## About the project

I tried to make sure I cover all aspects and best practices while building this project, but all included architecture, code, documentation and any other artifact represent my personal opinion only. Think of it as a suggestion of how a one way things can work.

Keep in mind that this is a work-in-progress, I will continue to contribute to it when I can.

All constructive feedback is welcomed üôè
